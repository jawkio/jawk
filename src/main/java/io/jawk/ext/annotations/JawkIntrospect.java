/**
 * Marks an extension function parameter used to inspect an AWK value: the
 * parameter receives the value exactly as the runtime stores it, and an
 * untyped variable or a missing array element is passed without being turned
 * into an assigned scalar.
 * <p>
 * Because the value can be an untyped placeholder, an uninitialized value, an
 * associative array, a precompiled regexp, or one of Jawk's raw scalar values
 * (see {@link JawkRawValue}), the annotated Java parameter must be declared as
 * {@link Object}. Type-introspection functions such as gawk's
 * {@code typeof()} and {@code isarray()} rely on this marker.
